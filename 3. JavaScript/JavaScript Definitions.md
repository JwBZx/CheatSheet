<h1>JavaScript Definitions</h1>

<b>#1: Length (.length):</b>
To discover the length of a string of characters (like your name, for example) first type the string in quotes. Then write a period (full stop) and the word length like this: “yourName”.length. So Length is typed out after a string and is used to find out the amount of characters in the string (that was written before it).
Example: "Jonathan".length would equal the number 8 (or "Jesus".length would equal the number 5)

<b>#2: Math Expressions (*, /, +, and -):</b>
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
Example: (8/4 === 2) means 8 divided by 4 is equal to the value of 2.
(4*2 === 8) means 4 multiplied by 2 is equal to the value of 8.
("===" is a comparison operator. See below/#14 for the definition of comparison
operators.)

<b>#3: ReferenceError:</b>
If you reference a variable (put the name of a variable) in your code that doesn't exist (or hasn't been typed out/created in your code), and you try to run your project, you will get a ReferenceError.
Example: "ReferenceError: Jonathan is not defined" (this would pop up if the word "Jonathan" is in your code, but you haven't referenced/created it in your code. The main cause of these errors, in my opinion, is either incorrect spelling or punctuation errors.)
(To see the definition of (a) "Variable", see below/#20.)

<b>#4: Comments (//):</b>
In JavaScript, the "//" sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read, and they (Comments) make your program easier to understand. When you look back at your code or when others want to collaborate with you, they can read your comments and easily figure out what your code does.
Example: // Hello! How are you?
// Hope you're doing good right now!
(The computer won't try to read/run the code above, because it is inside
of the two slashes.)

<b>#5: JavaScript (JS):</b>
A easy-to-learn programming language that has many uses:
making websites respond to user interaction, building apps and games (e.g. blackjack), accessing information on the Internet (e.g. find out the top trending words on Twitter by topic), organizing and presenting data (e.g. automate spreadsheet work; data
visualization), and more. JavaScript is the coding language that I learned from theof the two slashes.)
 making websites respond to user interaction, building apps and games (e.g. blackjack), accessing information on the Internet (e.g. find out the top trending words on Twitter by topic), organizing and presenting data (e.g. automate spreadsheet work; data visualization), and more. JavaScript is the coding language that I learned from the beginning of July 2015 to the middle of January 2016.

<b>#6: Confirm:</b>
These boxes can be used on websites to confirm things with users. You've probably seen them pop up when you try to delete important things or leave a website with unsaved changes.
confirm ("I feel awesome!");
confirm ("I am ready to go.");

<b>#7: Programming:</b>
-Programming is like writing a list of instructions to the computer so if can do cool
stuff with your information.
-Programs can't yet make your bed, but they can do math, keep track of your bank
account, or send a message to a friend.
-Programming is similar to baking cakes. Seriously! Imagine you are trying to teach
your friend Jane how to bake many different types of cake.
-Each cake takes in different ingredients (ie. Inputs). But the 'bake' instructions are
always the same. For example:
01. Pre-heat the oven at 300 degrees 02. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl 03. Put contents in oven for 30 mins
-And the output will be a different cake each time.
-It is tedious to have to repeat to Jane the same 'bake' instructions every time. What if we could just say 'bake' and Jane would know how to execute those three steps? That is exactly what a function is!
A big part of programming is debugging. That just means figuring out what the heck went wrong with your code. Why didn't it run?

<b>#8: Prompt:</b>
-To do any of these actions, the program needs an input. You can ask for input with a
prompt.
Examples:
1. prompt(" What is your name?"); 2. prompt("What is Ubuntu?");
Instructions:
Use the prompt command to ask the user where they are from. Check out the examples above for how to do this.
{On Line 1, I wrote:
Examples:
1. prompt(" What is your name?"); 2. prompt("What is Ubuntu?");
Instructions:
Use the prompt command to ask the user where they are from. Check out the examples above for how to do this.
{On Line 1, I wrote:
[1 prompt("Whereareyoufrom?");]
and a dialog box popped up like before that says:
"The page at www.codeacademy.com says:
Where are you from?"
and I entered in "Seneca, SC" and it all works! Awesome!}

<b>#9: Data: #10: Strings:</b>
-Data comes in various types. You have used two already!
a. numbers are quantities, just like you're used to. You can do math with them.
b. Strings are sequences of characters, like the letters a-z, spaces, and even numbers. These are all strings: " Ryan", "4", and " What is your name?" Strings are extremely useful as labels, names, and content for your programs.
-To make a number in your code, just write a number as numerals without quotes: 42,190.12334.
-To write a string, surround words with quotes: "What is your name?"
Instructions:
Length counts every character in the string - including spaces! {On Line 1, I wrote:
[1 "Whatisyourname?".length]
and it gave me an answer back as 18 characters. Awesome!}it "Data Type III: Booleans":
-Nice job! Next let's look at booleans. A boolean is either true or false.
-For example, comparing two numbers returns a true or false result: - 23 > 10 is true
- 5 < 4 is false
{On Line 1, I wrote:
[1 "I'm coding like a champ".length > 10 ]
and, once I clicked on "Save & Submit Code", it gave me an answer back on the right, which was true. So it worked! Sweet!}

<b>#11: Numbers:</b>
    <b>#12: Booleans:</b>
<b>#13: console.log (printing out):</b>
-You may have noticed that the interpreter doesn't print out every single thing it
does. So if we want to know what it's thinking, we sometimes have to ask it to speak to us.
- console.log() will take whatever is inside the parentheses and log it to the console below your code--that's why it's called console.log() !
-This is commonly called printing out.
console.log(2 * 5)
console.log("Hello")
{When you type the two statements above and then click on Save & Submit Code, then, in the console box on the right, it will print:
[ 10 Hello ]
and then that is it for that challenge! You completed it! Yay!}

<b>#14: Comparison Operators:</b>
Now let's learn more about comparison operators.
List of comparison operators:
- > Greater than
- < Less than
- <= Less than or equal to
- >= Greater than or equal to
- === Equal to
- !== Not equal to
[1 // Here is an example of using the greater than (>) operator.
2 console.log (15 > 4); // 15 > 4 evaluates to be true, so true is printed. 3
4 // Full in with >, <, === so that the following print out true:
5 console.log("XiaoHui".length 122);
6 console.log("GoodyDonaldson".length 8);
7 console.log(8*2 16);]
Here's a list of comparison operators: - > Greater than
- < Less than
- <= Less than or equal to
- >= Greater than or equal to
- ===Equalto[[[NotefromJonathan:===meansthateverythingworksWHENsome value equals a certain number or thing after the equals sign. So = is for assignment/declaration (var Hi = “Hi”) and === is to check for equality (var Hi === “Hi”
is checking if the variable Hi equals the string “Hi”. I think I get it now haha Writing
- < Less than
- <= Less than or equal to
- >= Greater than or equal to
 - === Equal to
[[[Note from Jonathan: === means that everything works WHEN some
 value equals a certain number or thing after the equals sign. So = is for
 assignment/declaration (var Hi = “Hi”) and === is to check for equality (var Hi === “Hi”
 is checking if the variable Hi equals the string “Hi”. I think I get it now haha Writing
 this note on August 26th, 2015]]]
 - !== Notequalto

<b>#15: if/else Statements:</b>
-Say we want to write a program that asks whether your name is longer than 7 letters. If the answer is yes, we can respond with "You have a long name!" We can do this with an if statement:
[ if( "my name".length >= 7 ) {
console.log("You have a long name!"); }]
-An if statement is made up of the if keyword, a condition like we've seen before, and a pair of curly braces { } . If the answer to the condition is yes, the code inside the curly braces will run.
Instructions:
Check out the if statement in the editor.
01. On line 1, add a condition inside the parentheses ( ) .
02. If the answer to the condition is yes, the code inside the curly braces will run. So on line 2, use console.log to print out a string.
[1 if ( ) {
2 console.log( );
3}]
-Just like before, if the condition is true , then only the code inside the first pair of curly braces will run. Otherwise, the condition is false, so only the code inside the second pair of curly braces after the else keyword will run.
-In the example above the condition "myName".length >= 7 evaluates to false since "myName" only has 6 letters. Since the condition is false , only the code inside the curly braces after the else keyword runs, and prints out You have a short name! .
[ if (condition)
{
// if condition is true
// do this code }
else // "otherwise" {
// do this code instead }]
-if / else statements are conditional statements. Under different conditions, the
computer will output different things.
}
else // "otherwise" {
// do this code instead }]
-if / else statements are conditional statements. Under different conditions, the computer will output different things.
-Anespeciallyusefulapplicationofreusablecodeis if/else statements.Thesecan be very wordy, and a pain to type repeatedly.
Here's an example of if / else syntax:
if (condition1) {
return "some string"; }
else {
return "some string"; }
Don't forget to put semi-colons at the end of each line of code inside the { } . And to put a semi-colon at the very end of the function.]]]

<b>#16: Syntax:</b>
-Well done! Now, computers are very literal. Syntax needs to be in exactly the right
place for the computer to understand the code.
-As you get started with programming, we will teach you many syntax rules. This is
sort of like the grammar of programming languages. Grammar first, then programming poetry!

<b>#17: Debugging:</b>
There are many mistakes in this code. Find them and fix them all.
You are doing what's called "debugging", a term popularized by Grace Hopper when she literally removed a moth from her computer.
A big part of programming is debugging. That just means figuring out what the heck went wrong with your code. Why didn't it run?
----
-We've covered a lot of ground so far! So many new terms, so much syntax. Let's take a breather and review. We have learned:
1. Confirm and prompt
We can make pop-up boxes appear! [confirm("I am ok"); ]
[prompt("Are you ok?"); ]
2. Data types
a. numbers (e.g. 4,3 , 134 )
 c. booleans (e.g. false , 5 > 4 )
3. Conditionals
If the first condition is met, execute the first code block. If it is not met, execute the
b. strings (e.g. "dogs go woof!", "JavaScript expert")
2. Data types
a. numbers (e.g. 4,3 , 134 )
 c. booleans (e.g. false , 5 > 4 )
3. Conditionals
If the first condition is met, execute the first code block. If it is not met, execute the code in the else block.
Code already in the code area:
[1 // This is an example of an if / else statement
2
3 if (12 / 4 === "Ari".length) {
4 confirm("Will this run the first block?"); 5 } else {
6 confirm("Or the second block?");
7}

-We saw some basic math before. The basic math symbols we learned in school work here. Even the order in which the computer understands the math is the same as in school!
Code:
1. ( ) : control order of operations
2. * and / : multiplication and division 3.- and+:subtractionandaddition
Examples:
1. 100/10 evaluates to 10
2. "Jane".length + 5 evaluates to 9 3. 5*(3+1) evaluates to 20
-----

<b>#18: Modulo (%):</b>
-Let's meet an interesting symbol called modulo. When % is placed between two numbers, the computer will divide the first number by the second, and then return the remainder of that division.
-Soifwedo23%10,wedivide23by10whichequals 2with3leftover.So23%10 evaluates to 3 .
More examples:
17 % 5 evaluates to 2 13 % 7 evaluates to 6
-So why learn modulo? For one thing, it's good at testing divisibility. Consider 30 % 10 . What does it return? There is nothing left over, so 0 .
How about 9 % 3? Also 0 .
-We can use modulo in comparisons, like this:
10 % 2 === 0 evaluates to true
7%3===0 evaluatestofalsebecausethereis1leftover.
b. strings (e.g. "dogs go woof!", "JavaScript expert")
#19: Substring:
10 . What does it return? There is nothing left over, so 0 .
How about 9 % 3? Also 0 .
-We can use modulo in comparisons, like this:
 10 % 2 === 0 evaluates to true
7%3===0 evaluatestofalsebecausethereis1leftover.

<b>#19: Substring:</b>
-We've learned a few ways to manipulate numbers. What about manipulating
strings?
-Sometimes you don't want to display the entire string, just a part of it. For example,
in your Gmail inbox, you can set it to display the first 50 or so characters of each message so you can preview them. This preview is a substring of the original string (the entire message).
Code:
"some word".substring(x, y) where x is where you start chopping and y is where you finish chopping the entire string.
The number part is a little strange. To select for the "he" in "hello", you would write this:
"hello".substring(0, 2);
Each character in a string is numbered starting from 0, like this:
01234
|||||
hello
The letter h is in position 0 , the letter e is in position 1 , and so on.
Therefore if you start at position 0 , and slice right up till position 2 , you are left with justhe.
More examples:
1. First 3 letters of "Batman"
"Batman".substring(0,3);
2. From 4th to 6th letter of "laptop"
"laptop".substring(3,6);
Instructions:
[1 // Be careful with the substring's letter positions!
2]
-Getting the positioning of substring letter positions is tricky! Let's make sure we really have it nailed down.
-Remember that each character in a string is numbered starting from 0. So for the word "hello", the letter h is in position 0 , the letter e is in position 1 , and so on. Code already in the code area:
[1 // Use console.log( ) to print out the substrings.
2 // Here is an example of the 1st to 4th letter of "JavaScript":
3 // console.log("JavaScript".substring(0,4);
4]
{To complete the instructions for this challenge and stuff, type the following lines of
code:
Code already in the code area:
[1 // Use console.log( ) to print out the substrings.
2 // Here is an example of the 1st to 4th letter of "JavaScript":
3 // console.log("JavaScript".substring(0,4);
4]
{To complete the instructions for this challenge and stuff, type the following lines of code:
[4 console.log("January".substring(0,3));
5 console.log("Melbourne is great".substring(0,12));
6 console.log("Hamburgers".substring(3,10));

<b>#20: Variables:</b>
-To do more complex coding, we need a way to 'save' the values from our coding.
We do this by defining a variable with a specific, case-sensitive name. Once you create (or declare) a variable as having a particular name, you can then call up that value by typing the variable name.
Code:
var varName = data;
Example:
a. var myName = "Leng"; b. var myAge = 30;
c. var isOdd = true;
-We have seen how to create a variable. But how do we use it? It is useful to think that any time you type the variable's name, you are asking the computer to swap out the variable name and swap in the value of the variable.
For example:
var myName = "Steve Jobs" ;
myName.substring(0,5)
Look at the second line above. You have asked the computer to swap out myName and swap in Steve Jobs , so
myName.substring(0,5)
becomes
"Steve Jobs".substring(0,5)
which evaluates to Steve .
Another example:
var myAge = 120;
What is
myAge % 12 ? See the hint to check your answer.
So the variable stores the value of the variable, whether that is a number or a string. As you will see soon, this makes writing long programs much easier!
 [1
// To create a variable, we use only one equals sign
   2/
/ But to check if two values are equal, we use 3 equal signs.
   -So far we've seen
a. how to create a variable b. how to use a variable
-Let's now see how to change a variable's value. A variable's value is easily changed.
myAge % 12 ? See the hint to check your answer.
So the variable stores the value of the variable, whether that is a number or a string. As you will see soon, this makes writing long programs much easier!
 -So far we've seen
a. how to create a variable b. how to use a variable
-Let's now see how to change a variable's value. A variable's value is easily changed. Just pretend you are creating a new variable while using the same name of the existing variable!
Example:
var myAge = "Thirty";
Say I had a birthday and I want to change my age.
myAge= "Thirty-one";
Now the value of myAge is "Thirty-one"!
[1 // On line 2, declare a variable myName and give it your name. 2

Instructions:
01. Line 3 declares the function and gives it a name.

04. On line 8-11, we explain what calling a function means.
05. On line 12, replace the 6 with any number and press Save & Submit Code. Do this a few times to see the beauty of functions!
-A function takes in inputs, does something with them, and produces an output.
-Here's an example of a function: var sayHello = function(name) {
console.log('Hello' + name); };
01. First we declare a function using var , and then give it a name sayHello . The name should begin with a lowercase letter and the convention is to use lowerCamelCase where each word (except the first) begins with a capital letter.
02. Then we use the function keyword to tell the computer that you are making a function.
03. The code in the parentheses is called a parameter. It's a placeholder word that we give a specific value when we call the function. Click "Stuck? Get a hint!" for more. 04. Then write your block of reusable code between { } . Every line of code in this block must end with a ; .
-You can run this code by "calling" the function, like this: sayHello("Emily");
Calling this function will print out Hello Emily .
-Let's break down exactly how a computer thinks when it sees the code for a function:
 // code code code
// code code code

-Let's break down exactly how a computer thinks when it sees the code for a function:
 // code code code

// (more lines of code)
};
01. The var keyword declares a variable named functionName .
02. The keyword function tells the computer that functionName is a function and not something else.
03. Parameters go in the parentheses. The computer will look out for it in the code block.
04. The code block is the reusable code that is between the curly brackets { }. Each line of code inside { } must end with a semi-colon.
05. The entire function ends with a semi-colon.
-To use the function, we call the function by just typing the function's name, and putting a parameter value inside parentheses after it. The computer will run the reusable code with the specific parameter value substituted into the code.

9 greeting var func{name}(console.log(name)))} ]
-Why is the code organized like it is on lines 2-5?
The computer can understand the code without such spacing. But it makes editing a lot easier and is best practice.
-Do I have to put a semi-colon at the end of each line of code in the reusable block? And at the end of the entire function?
Yes. At the end of each line of code (within the { } ) and after the entire function (after the { } ), please put a semi-colon. The semi-colon acts like a period in a sentence. It helps the computer know where there are stopping points in the code.
Instructions:
A big part of programming is debugging. That just means figuring out what the heck went wrong with your code. Why didn't it run?

<b>#22: lowerCamelCase:</b>
01. First we declare a function using var , and then give it a name sayHello . The name
 should begin with a lowercase letter and the convention is to use lowerCamelCase where each word (except the first) begins with a capital letter.
<b>#23: Parameter:
02. Focus on line 4 and line 5. The code within the curly brackets { } is the code we want to use again and again (i.e. the 'bake' instructions)
-A function takes in inputs, does something with them, and produces an output.

Calling this function will print out Hello Emily .
03. Parameters go in the parentheses. The computer will look out for it in the code block.
-So far we've only looked at functions with one parameter. But often it is useful to write functions with more than one parameter. For example, we can have the following function:
var areaBox = function(length, width) {
return length * width; };
With more than one parameter, we can create more useful functions.
-To call a function with more than one parameter, just enter a value for each

<b>#25: "Don't Repeat Yourself" (D.R.Y): "Don't Repeat Yourself (D.R.Y)":</b>
-The D.R.Y principle is really important in programming. No repeating!
-Any time you find yourself typing the same thing, but modifying only one small part, you can probably use a function.
-The 'small part' that you find yourself modifying will be the parameter. And the part that you keep repeating will be the code in the reusable block - the code inside { }.
Instructions:
You are a creature of habit. Every week you buy 5 oranges. But orange prices keep changing!
01. You want to declare a function that calculates the cost of buying 5 oranges.
02. You then want to calculate the cost of the 5 all together.
03. Write a function that does this called orangeCost() .
04. It should take a parameter that is the cost of an orange, and multiply it by 5.
05. It should log the result of the multiplication to the console.
06. Call the function where oranges each cost 5 dollars.
(((Hint=What is the one bit of input that changes each time? It would be the price. So give your parameter the name price . And when you call your function, put in a number for the price to see how much 5 oranges cost!)))
{{{To complete this Code Challenge, you are going to need to write all of the following code out:

<b>#26: Return (keyword):</b>
-Nice job! Now, when we call a function, we don't always want to just print stuff.
Sometimes, we just want it to return a value. We can then use that value (ie. the output from the function) in other code. Let's learn about the return keyword, then we'll see how to use functions with an if / else statement in the next exercise!
-The return keyword simply gives the programmer back the value that comes out of the function. So the function runs, and when the return keyword is used, the function will immediately stop running and return the value.

 function. That value can then be used just like any other value in JavaScript

<b>#27: Scope (Global or Local): "Global vs Local Variables":</b>
-Let's talk about an important concept: scope. Scope can be global or local.
-Variables defined outside a function are accessible anywhere once they have been declared. They are called global variables and their scope is global.
-For example:
var globalVar = "hello"; var foo = function() {
console.log(globalVar); //prints"hello" }
-The variable globalVar can be accessed anywhere, even inside the function foo .
-Variables defined inside a function are local variables. They cannot be accessed outside of that function.
-For example:
var bar = function() {
var localVar = "howdy"; }
console.log(localVar); // error
-The variable localVar only exists inside the function bar . Trying to
print localVar outside the function gives an error.
-Check out the code in the editor [which I will type out below]. Until now you've
been using the var keyword without really understanding why. The var keyword creates a new variable in the current scope. That means if var is used outside a function, that variable has a global scope. If var is used inside a function, that variable has a local scope.

<b>#28: Global Scope: "Global vs Local Variables":</b>
-Let's talk about an important concept: scope. Scope can be global or local.
-Variables defined outside a function are accessible anywhere once they have been declared. They are called global variables and their scope is global.
-For example:
var globalVar = "hello"; var foo = function() {
console.log(globalVar); //prints"hello" }
-The variable globalVar can be accessed anywhere, even inside the function foo .
-Variables defined inside a function are local variables. They cannot be accessed outside of that function.
-For example:
var foo = function() {
console.log(globalVar); //prints"hello" }
 -The variable globalVar can be accessed anywhere, even inside the function foo .
-Variables defined inside a function are local variables. They cannot be accessed outside of that function.
-For example:
var bar = function() {
var localVar = "howdy"; }
console.log(localVar); // error
-The variable localVar only exists inside the function bar . Trying to
print localVar outside the function gives an error.
-Check out the code in the editor [which I will type out below]. Until now you've
been using the var keyword without really understanding why. The var keyword creates a new variable in the current scope. That means if var is used outside a function, that variable has a global scope. If var is used inside a function, that variable has a local scope.

<b>#30: For Loops: "First for loop":</b>
-Instead of manually typing in console.log five times, we can use a for loop to do this. The aim of this exercise is just to show you how a for loop looks, and demonstrate how useful it is.
-We initially focus on using for loops just to count numbers to keep things simple. But by section 3, we will show you how to do more fancy things!
Code already in the code area:
[1 // Example of a for loop:
2
3 for(varcounter=1;counter<6;counter++){ 4 console.log(counter);
5}
6]
Instructions:
01. The for loop in the code will print out 1 to 5 and use far less code than you used in the previous exercise.
02. Change the 6 to 11 and press Save & Submit Code. This will see the computer print out 1 to 10!
"Starting the for loop"
-Congratulations!You'vejustrunyourfirst for loop.Butwhatyou'reprobablyreally keen to do is write your own for loop. Below is the general syntax of the for loop. We want to focus on the first line in the next few exercises.
Syntax:
[for (var i = 1; i < 11; i = i + 1) {
/* your code here */; }]
-Every for loop makes use of a counting variable. Here, our variable is called i (but it can have any name). The variable has many roles. The first part of the for loop tells the computer to start with a value of 1 for i . It does this by declaring the variable called i and giving it a value of 1 .
-When the for loop executes the code in the code block---the bit between { }---it doessobystartingoffwhere i=1.
"Ending the for loop"
 ends? Well, the second part of the for loop determines that. Syntax:
[for (var i = 1; i < 11; i = i + 1) {
-We know how to control where the for loop starts. How do we control where it code code code;
doessobystartingoffwhere i=1. "Ending the for loop"
 ends? Well, the second part of the for loop determines that. Syntax:
[for (var i = 1; i < 11; i = i + 1) {
code code code; }]
-Here,thisforloopwillkeeprunninguntil i=10 (i.e.while i<11).Sowhen i=2, or i = 9 , the for loop will run. But once i is no longer less than 11, the loop will stop. "Controlling the for loop"
-We can now control where the for loop starts and ends. What about controlling what happens in between?
-The examples we've looked at have used i = i + 1 . This has meant we have incremented (increased) the variable i by 1 each time.
Rules to learn:
a. A more efficient way to code to increment up by 1 is to write i++ .
b. We decrement down by 1 by writing i-- .
c. We can increment up by any value by writing i += x , where x is how much we want to increment up by. e.g., i += 3 counts up by 3s. d.Wecandecrementdownbyanyvaluebywriting i-=x .(SeetheHintformore.)
e. Be very careful with your syntax---if you write a loop that can't properly end, it's called an infinite loop. It will crash your browser!
Note: x+=y isthesameas x=x+y.And x-=y isthesameas x=x-y.]]]
"How does it work?"
-We've gone through the three bits of syntax for the for loop. But how exactly does it work? Let's imagine the steps the computer takes to run the for loop on the right [or down below for me/you reading this ;) ].
01.Itstartsoffwith i=2
02. It then asks: Is i currently less than 13? Because i = 2 , this is true and we continue.
03. We do NOT increment now. Instead, if the condition is met, we run the code block.
04. Here, the code block prints out the value of i . It is currently 2 so 2 will be printed out.
05. Once the code block is finished, the for loop then increments / decrements. Here, we add 1.
06.Now i=3.Wecheckifitislessthan13.Ifitistrue,werunthecodeblock. 07. The code block runs, and then we increment.
08. We repeat these steps until the condition i < 13 is no longer true. "Practice counting down"
- for loops only run when the condition is true . Do not run the code without changing it!
-It is important that there is a way for the for loop to end. If the for loop is always

going to be true, then you will be stuck in an infinite loop and your browser will crash!

-Look at the code. It is bad.
a.Itbeginsat i=1.
b.Itwillkeepgoingaslongas i>=1.
c. Because now i = 1 , the code will run.
d. We increment i by 1 and now i = 2 . This satisfies the condition. We run the code. e.Incrementiby1andnow i=3.Thissatisfiestheconditionthat i>=1.Werunthe code.
f. We will keep incrementing the code up by 1. It will always satisfy the condition. The loop NEVER ends! This will crash your computer!
-This loop will make sure each character of your name gets push ed to the final array.The if statementsays:"Ifwefindthefirstletterofthename,startthe second for loop!" This loop says: "I'm going to add characters to the array until I hit the length of the user's name." So if your name is 11 letters long, your loop should add 11 characters to hits if it ever sees the first letter of myName in text .
-For your second for loop, keep the following in mind:
First, you'll want to set your second loop's iterator to start at the first one, so it picks
up where that one left off. If your first loop starts with: [for(var i = 0; // rest of loop setup ]
your second should be something like:
[for(var j = i; // rest of loop setup
Second, think hard about when your loop should stop. Check the Hint if you get stuck!
Finally, in the body of your loop, have your program use the .push() method of hits . Just like strings and arrays have a .length method, arrays have a .push() method that adds the thing between parentheses to the end of the array. For example:
[newArray = [];
newArray.push('hello'); newArray[0]; // equals 'hello' ]
-Now, as we mentioned, this system isn't perfect. For instance, if the paragraph contains both "Eric" and "Eddie" , we'll see this in our hits array:
[ ['E', 'r', 'i', 'c', 'E', 'd', 'd', 'i', 'e']; ]

<b>#31: Arrays: "Meet arrays":</b>
 ONE number or ONE string. Good thing we have arrays. Arrays:
a. store lists of data
-Variables can store numbers or strings. But so far, we've only been able to stores ONE number or ONE string. Good thing we have arrays. Arrays:
a. store lists of data
b. can store different data types at the same time
c. are ordered so the position of each piece of data is fixed Example:
[var names = ["Moo", "Gandhi", "Mandela"];
var sizes = [4, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9];
var mixed = [34, "candy", "blue", 11]; ]
Syntax:
{ var arrayName = [data, data, data]; }
Any time you see data surrounded by [ ], it is an array. "Array positions"
-It's nice that we can put a list of data into an array. But now we need to learn how to get access to the data inside the array.
-The position of things in arrays is fixed. So we just need to know the array name (here, it is junkData ), and the position of the data we want, and we're done.
-Small complication: the position (or the index) of each bit of data is counted starting from 0, or 1.
01.Firstelementinthearray: junkData[0]
02. Second element in the array: junkData[1]
Arrays have 0-based indexing, so we start counting the positions from 0. "Loops and arrays I"
-Awesome job! You've now learned about arrays, and how to access one element of the array. But what if there were 100 elements in the array?
-For arrays, a useful way to systematically access every element in the array is to use a for loop!
How does it work?
1. Line 3 declares the array. It has 4 elements.
2. We then start the for loop on line 5.
3.Wesee i startsoffatvalue0.
4. The for loop runs until i < 4 (because cities.length equals 4. The array cities has 4 elements in it; see the Hint for more.)
5. We will increment i by 1 each time we loop over.
6. We print out cities[0] , which is "Melbourne" .
7. We then start the loop again. Except now i = 1 .
8. It will print out cities[1] , which is "Amman" .
9. This continues until i is no longer less than cities.length .
[[[Hint:
This combination of for loops and arrays is used a lot. In particular, pay attention to the condition part of the for loop where we have
-Variables can store numbers or strings. But so far, we've only been able to store

9. This continues until i is no longer less than cities.length .
 [[[Hint:
This combination of for loops and arrays is used a lot. In particular, pay attention to the condition part of the for loop where we have
i < cities.length
This is a pattern we often see.
The length of the cities array is 4. But when we are accessing the array, the last index position of the array[3]---zero-based indexing! Keep this in mind!
Remember, arrays look like this:
var arrayName = [1, 2, 3]; ]]]
-We'll want to place the if statement inside our for loop to make sure the program checksthe if statementeachtimeitmovesforwardthroughtheloop.
Essentially, the for loop is saying: "Hey program! Go through every enter in 'text'." The if statement will say: if you see something interesting, push that text into an array!"
-You can treat a string like an array of characters. For instance, you know that: [var myArray = ['hello', 'world'];
myArray[0]; // equals 'hello' ]
But this also works on strings!:
[var myName = 'Eric'; myName[0]; // equals 'E' ]

<b>#32: Zero-Based Indexing:</b>

<b>#33: Backslash (\) [Equivalent to ENTER on Keyboard in a sense]:</b>
-Since text could be quite long, you can use a backslash ( \ ) at the end of each line
to make your string "wrap" to the next line, like this: [var text = "Hey, how are you \
doing? My name is Emily."; ]
Inthisway,usingbackslashes( \ )isusefulbecauseyoucanavoidreallylonglines! -You can ignore the /*jshint ...line for now. All that does is tell the console to stop
worrying about our use of backslash characters for wrapping long lines of text.

<b>#35: While Loop:</b>
-But what if you didn't know ahead of time when to stop looping? Say, for example,
you wanted to keep choosing playing cards from a deck until you get a spade. You don't know how many cards you'll need to choose, so a for loop won't work.
-In situations like these where you don't know in advance where to stop looping, we canusea while loop.

"While syntax"
-The while loop is ideal when you want to use a loop, but you don't know how many times you'll have to execute that loop.
-In the example you just saw, the computer was randomly flipping a coin: while the coin came up heads (when coinFace equalled 0), it would flip again, and it would stop flopping once it got tails (when coinFace was 1). Since the flip was random, we didn't know ahead of time how many loops we'd need.
-The syntax looks like this: [while(condition){
// Do something! }]
-As long as the condition evaluates to true , the loop will continue to run. As soon as it's false , it'll stop. (When you use a number in a condition, as we did earlier, JavaScript understands 1 to mean true and 0 to mean false .)
-Since you've already mastered for loops, this simpler syntax should be a breeze for you.
