<h1>Comments</h1>

<b>Comments</b>: <i>How to make notes to yourself and editors who come after you.</i>

HTML Comments:

Comment tags are used to insert comments in the HTML source code.

HTML Comment Tags:

You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
```
<!-- Write your comments here -->
```
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the opening tag, but not in the closing tag.

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML:

Example:
```
<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -->
```
Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors:

Example:
```
<!-- Do not display this at the moment
<img border="0" src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain">
-->
```
Conditional Comments:

You might stumble upon conditional comments in HTML:
```
<!--[if IE 9]>
    .... some HTML here ....
<![endif]-->
```
Conditional comments defines some HTML tags to be executed by Internet Explorer only.
