<h3>Basic (HTML) Concepts:</h3>

<h1>Elements</h1>

<b>Elements</b>: <i>The building blocks of a page. Also pay attention to the section on next elements.</i>

-----
HTML Elements:
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>


<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>

{HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).}

Nested HTML Elements:
HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

This example contains four HTML elements:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Example Explained:
The <html> element defines the whole document.

It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

The element content is another HTML element (the <body> element).

<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

The <body> element defines the document body.

It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.

The element content is two other HTML elements (<h1> and <p>).

<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>

The <h1> element defines a heading.

It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>.

The element content is: My First Heading.

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

The <p> element defines a paragraph.

It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>.

The element content is: My first paragraph.

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Do Not Forget the End Tag:
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

Example
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is a paragraph

</body>
</html>

The example above works in all browsers, because the closing tag is considered optional.

Never rely on this. It might produce unexpected results and/or errors if you forget the end tag.

Empty HTML Elements:
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

<br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break).

Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.

HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if you want stricter validation, or if you need to make your document readable by XML parsers, you must close all HTML elements properly.

Use Lowercase Tags:
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

At W3Schools we always use lowercase tags.

<h1>Attributes</h1>

<b>Attributes</b>: <i>Adding information to elements, something that is especially useful for CSS and JQuery.</i>

-----
HTML Attributes:
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Attributes:
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The lang Attribute:
The language of the document can be declared in the <html> tag.

The language is declared with the lang attribute.

Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>

...

</body>
</html>

The first two letters specify the language (en). If there is a dialect, use two more letters (US).

The title Attribute:
Here, a title attribute is added to the <p> element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the paragraph:

Example:

<p title="I'm a tooltip">
This is a paragraph.
</p>

The href Attribute:
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:

Example:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

You will learn more about links and the <a> tag later in this tutorial.

Size Attributes:
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The filename of the source (src), and the size of the image (width and height) are all provided as attributes:

Example:

<img src="w3schools.jpg" width="104" height="142">

The image size is specified in pixels: width="104" means 104 screen pixels wide.

You will learn more about images and the <img> tag later in this tutorial.

The alt Attribute:
The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.

The value of the attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a blind person, can "hear" the element.

Example:

<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

We Suggest: Use Lowercase Attributes:
The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

The title attribute can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names.

We Suggest: Quote Attribute Values:
The HTML5 standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

The href attribute, demonstrated above, can be written as:

Example:

<a href=https://www.w3schools.com>

W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

Sometimes it is necessary to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:

Example:

<p title=About W3Schools>

Using quotes are the most common. Omitting quotes can produce errors.
At W3Schools we always use quotes around attribute values.

Single or Double Quotes?:
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>

Or vice versa:

<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">

Chapter Summary
All HTML elements can have attributes
The title attribute provides additional "tool-tip" information
The href attribute provides address information for links
The width and height attributes provide size information for images
The alt attribute provides text for screen readers
At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names
At W3Schools we always quote attribute values with double quotes

HTML Attributes [List]:

Below is an alphabetical list of some attributes often used in HTML:

Attribute	Description:
<b>alt:</b> Specifies an alternative text for an image, when the image cannot be displayed
<b>disabled:</b> Specifies that an input element should be disabled
<b>href:</b> Specifies the URL (web address) for a link
<b>id:</b> Specifies a unique id for an element
<b>src:</b> Specifies the URL (web address) for an image
<b>style:</b> Specifies an inline CSS style for an element
<b>title:</b> Specifies extra information about an element (displayed as a tool tip)

<h1>Links</h1>

<b>Links</b>: <i>Create links to bookmarks on a page, other files in the site, or external pages.</i>

-----
HTML Links:
Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

HTML Links - Hyperlinks:
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.

HTML Links - Syntax:
In HTML, links are defined with the <a> tag:

<a href="url">link text</a>

Example:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>

The href attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.w3schools.com/html/) of the link.

The link text is the visible part (Visit our HTML tutorial).

Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.

Note: Without a forward slash on subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the address, and then create a new request.

Local Links:
The example above used an absolute URL (A full web address).

A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without http://www....).

Example

<a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a>

HTML Link Colors:
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
You can change the default colors, by using styles:

Example:

<style>
a:link {
    color: green;
    background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
    color: pink;
    background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
    color: red;
    background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
    color: yellow;
    background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</style>

HTML Links - The target Attribute:
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_ blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_ self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
_ parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_ top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame

[<b>NOTE FROM JONATHAN:</b> There is <b>no</b> space between the underline and the target attribute, it's just that Atom thought I was adding a comment or something blah blah so <b>don't put a space in between!</b>]
This example will open the linked document in a new browser window/tab:

Example:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_ blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

Tip: If your webpage is locked in a frame, you can use target="_ top" to break out of the frame:

Example:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_ top">HTML5 tutorial!</a>

HTML Links - Image as Link:
It is common to use images as links:

Example:

<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;">
</a>

Note: border:0; is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link).

HTML Links - Create a Bookmark:
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.

Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.

To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

Example:
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute:

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>

Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:

Example:

<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

External Paths:
External pages can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

This example uses a full URL to link to a web page:

Example:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

This example links to a page located in the html folder on the current web site:

Example:

<a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

This example links to a page located in the same folder as the current page:

Example:

<a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths.

Chapter Summary:
Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark

HTML Link Tags:
<b><a>:</b>	Defines a hyperlink
-----

<h1>Head</h1>

<b>Head</b>: <i>The element that tells the browser what to do with this file.</i>

-----
HTML Head:

The HTML <head> Element:
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.

The following tags describe metadata: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.

The HTML <title> Element:
The <title> element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser tab
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search engine results

A simple HTML document:

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<body>
The content of the document......
</body>

</html>

The HTML <style> Element:
The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page:

Example:

<style>
  body {background-color: powderblue;}
  h1 {color: red;}
  p {color: blue;}
</style>

The HTML <link> Element:
The <link> element is used to link to external style sheets:

Example:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">

Tip: To learn all about CSS, visit our CSS Tutorial.

The HTML <meta> Element:
The <meta> element is used to specify which character set is used, page description, keywords, author, and other metadata.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.

Define the character set used:

<meta charset="UTF-8">

Define a description of your web page:

<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">

Define keywords for search engines:

<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript">

Define the author of a page:

<meta name="author" content="John Doe">

Refresh document every 30 seconds:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

Example of <meta> tags:

Example:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML,CSS,XML,JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">

Setting The Viewport:
HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

The HTML <script> Element:
The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.

This JavaScript writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":

Example:

<script>
function myFunction {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
}
</script>

Tip: To learn all about JavaScript, visit our JavaScript Tutorial.

The HTML <base> Element:
The <base> element specifies the base URL and base target for all relative URLs in a page:

Example:

<base href="https://www.w3schools.com/images/" target="_ blank">

Omitting <html>, <head> and <body>?:
According to the HTML5 standard; the <html>, the <body>, and the <head> tag can be omitted.

The following code will validate as HTML5:

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Page Title</title>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Note:

W3Schools does not recommend omitting the <html> and <body> tags. Omitting these tags can crash DOM or XML software and produce errors in older browsers (IE9).

However, omitting the <head> tag has been a common practice for quite some time now.

HTML head Elements:
<b><head>:</b> Defines information about the document
<b><title>:</b> Defines the title of a document
<b><base>:</b> Defines a default address or a default target for all links on a page
<b><link>:</b> Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource
<b><meta>:</b> Defines metadata about an HTML document
<b><script>:</b> Defines a client-side script
<b><style>:</b>	Defines style information for a document
