<h1>What You'll Be Doing With Detail Pages And Record Editing:</h1>

From a master list, link to a detail page
Use the $_ GET method to create a detail page from a link on your index page.

Create a session variable and use it on the detail page
Pass some kind of data from your index page to the detail page as a session variable and display it there.

Delete a record
From the detail page, create a short form that deletes that item. This is not terribly great practice (you'd want to add a confirmation step before wiping out data so easily), but easy is what we're about at this stage. When the data has been deleted, take the user back to the index page.

Update a record
Create a page that allows users to update your data. Copy and paste the form you've been using so far, then, from a query on that editing page, pre-fill the input fields in the form. When the data has been updated, take the user back to the detail page you created in the first step (above).
