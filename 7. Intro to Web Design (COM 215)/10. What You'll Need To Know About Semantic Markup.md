<h1>What You'll Need To Know About Semantic Markup:</h1>

<b>Semantics</b> is the process of identifying page elements in ways that make sense to us and browsers. As people access content in many different ways (traditional computer screens, tablets, phones, televisions, glasses, watches, etc.), we need to know how to identify the content so that it can be presented properly, whatever device it appears in. HTML5 provides a list of standard tags, to which we can add even more (see the sections on div and span tags below).

<h2>HTML5 Semantic Elements:</h2>

Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.

Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

<h5>What are Semantic Elements?:</h5>

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

<h5>New Semantic Elements in HTML5:</h5>

Many web sites contain HTML code like: < div id="nav" >, < div class="header" >, < div id="footer" >
to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

HTML5 offers new semantic elements to define different parts of a web page:  

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>

<h3>HTML5 Semantic Elements:</h3>

<h5>HTML5 <section> Element:</h5>

The <section> element defines a section in a document.

According to W3C's HTML5 documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."

A home page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

Example:

```
<section>
  <h1>WWF</h1>
  <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is....</p>
</section>
```

<h5>HTML5 <article> Element:</h5>

The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where an <article> element can be used:

Forum post
Blog post
Newspaper article

Example:

```
<article>
  <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,
  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
</article>
```

<h5>Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?:</h5>

The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

The <section> element defines section in a document.

Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

So, on the Internet, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <sections> elements.

You will also find pages with <section> elements containing <section> elements, and <article> elements containing <article> elements.

Example for a newspaper: The sport articles in the sport section, may have a technical section in each article.

<h5>HTML5 <header> Element:</h5>

The <header> element specifies a header for a document or section.

The <header> element should be used as a container for introductory content.

You can have several <header> elements in one document.

The following example defines a header for an article:

Example:

```
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
    <p>WWF's mission:</p>
  </header>
  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,
  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
</article>
```

<h5>HTML5 <footer> Element:</h5>

The <footer> element specifies a footer for a document or section.

A <footer> element should contain information about its containing element.

A footer typically contains the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use, contact information, etc.

You may have several <footer> elements in one document.

Example:

```
<footer>
  <p>Posted by: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p>Contact information: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">
  someone@example.com</a>.</p>
</footer>
```

<h5>HTML5 <nav> Element:</h5>

The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.

Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links.

Example:

```
<nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav>
```

<h5>HTML5 <aside> Element:</h5>

The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.

Example:

```
<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer.</p>

<aside>
  <h4>Epcot Center</h4>
  <p>The Epcot Center is a theme park in Disney World, Florida.</p>
</aside>
```

<h5>HTML5 <figure> and <figcaption> Elements:</h5>

The purpose of a figure caption is to add a visual explanation to an image.

In HTML5, an image and a caption can be grouped together in a <figure> element:

Example:

```
<figure>
  <img src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="The Pulpit Rock" width="304" height="228">
  <figcaption>Fig1. - The Pulpit Rock, Norway.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The <img> element defines the image, the <figcaption> element defines the caption.

<h5>Why Semantic Elements?:</h5>

With HTML4, developers used their own id/class names to style elements: header, top, bottom, footer, menu, navigation, main, container, content, article, sidebar, topnav, etc.

This made it impossible for search engines to identify the correct web page content.

With the new HTML5 elements (<header> <footer> <nav> <section> <article>), this will become easier.

According to the W3C, a Semantic Web: "Allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."

<h4>Semantic Elements in HTML5:</h4>

Below is an alphabetical list of the new semantic elements in HTML5.

The links go to our complete HTML5 Reference.

Tag	Description:

<b><article>:</b>	Defines an article
<b><aside>:</b>	Defines content aside from the page content
<b><details>:</b>	Defines additional details that the user can view or hide
<b><figcaption>:</b>	Defines a caption for a <figure> element
<b><figure>:</b>	Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
<b><footer>:</b>	Defines a footer for a document or section
<b><header>:</b>	Specifies a header for a document or section
<b><main>:</b>	Specifies the main content of a document
<b><mark>:</b>	Defines marked/highlighted text
<b><nav>:</b>	Defines navigation links
<b><section>:</b>	Defines a section in a document
<b><summary>:</b>	Defines a visible heading for a <details> element
<b><time>:</b>	Defines a date/time

-----

Note that some elements, like articles and sections, require child elements like headings to validate properly. (A child is an element that appears inside another element, kind of like living in its parents' house. You've already met the <head> and <body> tags, which are children of <html>. )

<h3>Document Object Model:</h3>

The <b>Document Object Model, or DOM,</b> is the organized structure of the page as it's seen by the browser. It's not crucial that you understand it fully now, but it does matter that we keep everything arranged into sections and hierarchies. This video explains its importance and why semantics is important.


<h3>DIV tags:</h3>
<b>Div tags</b> (SEE BELOW) set off a unit of content so that we can identify it and manipulate it by CSS or Javascript later. If we're creating div's, we need to describe them by using an id or class.

-----

<h2>HTML <div> Tag:</h2>

Example:

A section in a document that will be displayed in blue:

```
<div style="color:#0000FF">
  <h3>This is a heading</h3>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

Definition and Usage:

The <b><div></b> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.

Tips and Notes:

Tip: The <div> element is very often used together with CSS, to layout a web page.

Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element. However, this can be changed with CSS.

Differences Between HTML 4.01 and HTML5:

The align attribute not supported in HTML5.

-----

<h3>ID attribute:</h3>
If we have content that appears only once on a page, we identify it with an id (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. attribute inside the div tag. For example:

```
<div id="order_form"> ...we build the order form... </div>
```

IDs can be assigned to any element, not just divs, though. The important thing is that they only be used once on a page.

<h3>Class attribute:</h3>

Perhaps we have a catalog where we show multiple products on the same page. We could identify each product section with a <div>, though we can't use <div id="product_description"> because that div would repeat many times on the page. Instead, for repeating elements, we assign a class attribute (SEE BELOW) to it, so we could have <div class="product_description"> as many times as we wanted on a page.

-----

<h2>HTML id Attribute:</h2>

Example:

Use the id attribute to manipulate text with JavaScript:

```
<html>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">Hello World!</h1>
<button onclick="displayResult()">Change text</button>

<script>
function displayResult() {
    document.getElementById("myHeader").innerHTML = "Have a nice day!";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

More "Try it Yourself" examples below.

<b>Definition and Usage:</b>

The <b>id attribute</b> specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document).

The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to manipulate the element with the specific id.

Differences Between HTML 4.01 and HTML5:

In HTML5, the id attribute can be used on any HTML element (it will validate on any HTML element. However, it is not necessarily useful).

In HTML 4.01, the id attribute cannot be used with: <base>, <head>, <html>, <meta>, <param>, <script>, <style>, and <title>.

Note: HTML 4.01 has greater restrictions on the content of id values (for example; in HTML 4.01 id values cannot start with a number).

Syntax:

```
<element id="id">
```

Attribute Values:

Value	Description:

<b>id:</b> Specifies a unique id for the element. Naming rules:
Must contain at least one character
Must not contain any space characters
In HTML, all values are case-insensitive

<b>More Examples:</b>

Example 1:

Use the id attribute to link to an element with a specified id within a page:

```
<html>
<body>

<h2><a id="top">Some heading</a></h2>

<p>Lots of text....</p>
<p>Lots of text....</p>
<p>Lots of text....</p>

<a href="#top">Go to top</a>

</body>
</html>
```

Example 2:

Use the id attribute to style text with CSS:

```
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">W3Schools is the best!</h1>

</body>
</html>
```
-----

Consider IDs like your first name and classes like your last name. Everyone in your family has something in common, so we give you the same class and call it "Smith." That's helpful, but it doesn't let us distinguish between John and Mary, so we give those unique IDs. If we were coding a family, it might look something like this:

```
<p id="john" class="smith">This is John.</p>
<p id="mary" class="smith">This is Mary.</p>
```

We can assign multiple classes to an element, too. Perhaps we want to highlight items that are on sale, so we could do something like <div class="product_description on_sale">. Leave a space between class names and add a closing quotation mark after the final one.

Back to the family example, we can include Mary's maiden name as a second class.

```
<p id="mary" class="smith jones">This is Mary.</p>
```

(Note that all the names in the id and class attributes are uncapitalized, though the names outside the tag, which are intended for humans to read, are.)

Classes and ids are not reserved just for divs. We can add them to images, paragraphs, headings, or anything.

<h3>Span tag:</h3>
While <div> creates a new block (see block vs. inline to recall the difference), we can also put hooks into inline content that will allow us to make changes via CSS or Javascript. If I'm writing a theology paper and I want to do something special with Scripture references, I could identify each reference with a <span> tag. For example:

```
<p>The shortest verse in the Bible is <span class="scripture_reference">John 11:35</span>.</p>
```

We will usually need to identify the span with a class so that we can find it later.

<h3>Coding, spacing, and capitalization:</h3>

As you may have noticed in the previous examples, all the code is in lower case, and multi-word classes are separated by underlines. Some coding languages are case insensitive (HTML, for example), and others are case sensitive (JavaScript). As a rule of thumb, keep your HTML code lower case and use an underline if you need to join words together.

An alternative to underlining that some coders use is called <b>camel casing</b>, where the second word is capitalized instead of an underline. For example: class="scriptureReference".

Inside code, spaces are irrelevant.

```
<div id="123 abc">
```

is the same as

```
<div    id  = "  123    abc "   >
```
