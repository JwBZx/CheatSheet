<h1>What You'll Be Doing With SQL Queries:</h1>

Create a query that joins two databases
Construct a multi-table query that pulls information from at least two tables. For example, if you had two tables listing student names and concentrations, you should be able to create a list of all the students along with their concentration.

Display records on a page
Using a loop, display at least two records from the same dataset (list items, paragraphs, stories, etc) on a page. Use the multi-table query that you already created.

Create a dynamic form menu
Using a relatively small dataset from your database (a table of categories, for example), construct a form menu or list of selectable elements that is generated from a query.
