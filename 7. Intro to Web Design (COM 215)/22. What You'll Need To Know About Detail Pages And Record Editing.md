<h1>What You'll Need To Know About Detail Pages And Record Editing:</h1>

Passing data between pages
$_ GET (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. This data is passed in the URL, so it's visible to users. In most cases, you'll be passing primary key information so that you can search for a single record. For example, catalog.php?product_id=123 will let us create a query that only pulls information for the produce with the id of 123. For long content (text from forms) or secure data (passwords), you'd use $_ POST instead. (In the link, scroll down to the _ POST and _ GET sections at the bottom of the page.)

$_ SESSION (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. Temporarily stores data like usernames while a visitor is at the site. They can be used to create a login verification, for example, so that once someone successfully logs into a site, we can create a session variable called something like "$_ SESSION['login'] = true", then test that on every page. Once the session expires (when the window is closed or when it's destroyed when a user logs out), the login will become false and the pages can redirect users to the login screen.

$_ COOKIE (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. This leaves little pieces of data stored to the user's hard drive. Because the data is associated with your url, you can have your pages look here whenever the url is visited. Sites commonly store user id's here (never passwords) so they know who's visiting. This is why Amazon and Netflix know who you are when you visit their sites.

Updating records
Update (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. syntax. Use the primary key in the "where" statement to specify what record you're updating, otherwise every record will change.

Deleting records
Similar syntax (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and method (use primary key) to updating, except that your record is gone.

Redirecting to another page
We can tell PHP to take us to another page when it's finished running a script using the header (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. function. For example, we can take users to one page if they successfully log in, and to another if they fail. The header function is also commonly used after forms so that the page redirects after a record has been processed. (In the linked page, you only need to understand the first example. The other two examples lower on the page are not applicable to what we're doing.)

PHP Global Variables - Superglobals:
Several predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.

The PHP superglobal variables are:

$GLOBALS
$_ SERVER
$_ REQUEST
$_ POST
$_ GET
$_ FILES
$_ ENV
$_ COOKIE
$_ SESSION


PHP $_ POST
PHP $_ POST is widely used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with method="post". $_ POST is also widely used to pass variables.

The example below shows a form with an input field and a submit button. When a user submits the data by clicking on "Submit", the form data is sent to the file specified in the action attribute of the <form> tag. In this example, we point to the file itself for processing form data. If you wish to use another PHP file to process form data, replace that with the filename of your choice. Then, we can use the super global variable $_ POST to collect the value of the input field:

Example
<html>
<body>

<form method="post" action="<?php echo $_ SERVER['PHP_SELF'];?>">
  Name: <input type="text" name="fname">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<?php
if ($_ SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // collect value of input field
    $name = $_ POST['fname'];
    if (empty($name)) {
        echo "Name is empty";
    } else {
        echo $name;
    }
}
?>

</body>
</html>
Run example »
PHP $_ GET
PHP $_ GET can also be used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with method="get".

$_ GET can also collect data sent in the URL.

Assume we have an HTML page that contains a hyperlink with parameters:

<html>
<body>

<a href="test_get.php?subject=PHP&web=W3schools.com">Test $GET</a>

</body>
</html>
When a user clicks on the link "Test $GET", the parameters "subject" and "web" are sent to "test_get.php", and you can then access their values in "test_get.php" with $_ GET.

The example below shows the code in "test_get.php":

Example
<html>
<body>

<?php
echo "Study " . $_ GET['subject'] . " at " . $_ GET['web'];
?>

</body>
</html>

PHP 5 Sessions
❮ PreviousNext ❯
A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.

Unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the users computer.

What is a PHP Session?
When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, and then you close it. This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. It knows when you start the application and when you end. But on the internet there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.

Session variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used across multiple pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables last until the user closes the browser.

So; Session variables hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application.

Tip: If you need a permanent storage, you may want to store the data in a database.

Start a PHP Session
A session is started with the session_start() function.

Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_ SESSION.

Now, let's create a new page called "demo_session1.php". In this page, we start a new PHP session and set some session variables:

Example
<?php
// Start the session
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// Set session variables
$_ SESSION["favcolor"] = "green";
$_ SESSION["favanimal"] = "cat";
echo "Session variables are set.";
?>

</body>
</html>
Run example »
Note: The session_start() function must be the very first thing in your document. Before any HTML tags.


Get PHP Session Variable Values
Next, we create another page called "demo_session2.php". From this page, we will access the session information we set on the first page ("demo_session1.php").

Notice that session variables are not passed individually to each new page, instead they are retrieved from the session we open at the beginning of each page (session_start()).

Also notice that all session variable values are stored in the global $_ SESSION variable:

Example
<?php
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// Echo session variables that were set on previous page
echo "Favorite color is " . $_ SESSION["favcolor"] . ".<br>";
echo "Favorite animal is " . $_ SESSION["favanimal"] . ".";
?>

</body>
</html>
Run example »
Another way to show all the session variable values for a user session is to run the following code:

Example
<?php
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
print_r($_ SESSION);
?>

</body>
</html>
Run example »
How does it work? How does it know it's me?

Most sessions set a user-key on the user's computer that looks something like this: 765487cf34ert8dede5a562e4f3a7e12. Then, when a session is opened on another page, it scans the computer for a user-key. If there is a match, it accesses that session, if not, it starts a new session.

Modify a PHP Session Variable
To change a session variable, just overwrite it:

Example
<?php
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// to change a session variable, just overwrite it
$_ SESSION["favcolor"] = "yellow";
print_r($_ SESSION);
?>

</body>
</html>
Run example »
Destroy a PHP Session
To remove all global session variables and destroy the session, use session_unset() and session_destroy():

Example
<?php
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// remove all session variables
session_unset();

// destroy the session
session_destroy();
?>

</body>
</html>

PHP 5 Cookies
❮ PreviousNext ❯
A cookie is often used to identify a user.

What is a Cookie?
A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.

Create Cookies With PHP
A cookie is created with the setcookie() function.

Syntax
setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);
Only the name parameter is required. All other parameters are optional.

PHP Create/Retrieve a Cookie
The following example creates a cookie named "user" with the value "John Doe". The cookie will expire after 30 days (86400 * 30). The "/" means that the cookie is available in entire website (otherwise, select the directory you prefer).

We then retrieve the value of the cookie "user" (using the global variable $_ COOKIE). We also use the isset() function to find out if the cookie is set:

Example
<?php
$cookie_name = "user";
$cookie_value = "John Doe";
setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), "/"); // 86400 = 1 day
?>
<html>
<body>

<?php
if(!isset($_ COOKIE[$cookie_name])) {
    echo "Cookie named '" . $cookie_name . "' is not set!";
} else {
    echo "Cookie '" . $cookie_name . "' is set!<br>";
    echo "Value is: " . $_ COOKIE[$cookie_name];
}
?>

</body>
</html>
Run example »
Note: The setcookie() function must appear BEFORE the <html> tag.

Note: The value of the cookie is automatically URLencoded when sending the cookie, and automatically decoded when received (to prevent URLencoding, use setrawcookie() instead).


Modify a Cookie Value
To modify a cookie, just set (again) the cookie using the setcookie() function:

Example
<?php
$cookie_name = "user";
$cookie_value = "Alex Porter";
setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), "/");
?>
<html>
<body>

<?php
if(!isset($_ COOKIE[$cookie_name])) {
    echo "Cookie named '" . $cookie_name . "' is not set!";
} else {
    echo "Cookie '" . $cookie_name . "' is set!<br>";
    echo "Value is: " . $_ COOKIE[$cookie_name];
}
?>

</body>
</html>
Run example »
Delete a Cookie
To delete a cookie, use the setcookie() function with an expiration date in the past:

Example
<?php
// set the expiration date to one hour ago
setcookie("user", "", time() - 3600);
?>
<html>
<body>

<?php
echo "Cookie 'user' is deleted.";
?>

</body>
</html>
Run example »
Check if Cookies are Enabled
The following example creates a small script that checks whether cookies are enabled. First, try to create a test cookie with the setcookie() function, then count the $_ COOKIE array variable:

Example
<?php
setcookie("test_cookie", "test", time() + 3600, '/');
?>
<html>
<body>

<?php
if(count($_ COOKIE) > 0) {
    echo "Cookies are enabled.";
} else {
    echo "Cookies are disabled.";
}
?>

</body>
</html>

SQL UPDATE Statement
❮ PreviousNext ❯
The SQL UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE Syntax
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!

Delete All Records
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:

DELETE FROM table_name;
or:

DELETE * FROM table_name;

PHP header() Function
❮ Complete PHP HTTP Reference
Definition and Usage
The header() function sends a raw HTTP header to a client.

It is important to notice that header() must be called before any actual output is sent (In PHP 4 and later, you can use output buffering to solve this problem):

<html>
<?php
// This results in an error.
// The output above is before the header() call
header('Location: http://www.example.com/');
?>
Syntax
header(string,replace,http_response_code)

Parameter	Description
string	Required. Specifies the header string to send
replace	Optional. Indicates whether the header should replace previous or add a second header. Default is TRUE (will replace). FALSE (allows multiple headers of the same type)
http_response_code	Optional. Forces the HTTP response code to the specified value (available in PHP 4.3 and higher)
Tips and Notes
Note: Since PHP 4.4 this function prevents more than one header to be sent at once. This is a protection against header injection attacks.


Example 1
Prevent page caching:

<?php
// Date in the past
header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT");
header("Cache-Control: no-cache");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
?>

<html>
<body>

...
...
Note: There are options that users may set to change the browser's default caching settings. By sending the headers above, you should override any of those settings and force the browser to not cache!
