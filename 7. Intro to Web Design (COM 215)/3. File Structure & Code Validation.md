<h3>File Structure & Code Validation</h3>

<h1>File Structure</h1>

-----
File Structure:

<b>Index file:</b> Your site should have a file named index (it can be index.html, index.php, index.etc) which will be the default file a browser will open if someone accesses your site without specifying a particular file.

<b>Folders and directories (Links to an external site.):</b>
<h3>Site File Structure:</h3>

Like the inner workings of a fine watch, the internal details of your site are craftwork that only other technologists will see, but your users will benefit from careful planning and thought. Discussions about site and page structure usually center around the most visible aspects of navigation, user interface, and content organization, but attention to the file and directory structure and how you name things within your site can produce big payoffs in:

Understanding: Your current team, future site maintainers, and most site users will benefit from careful, consistent, plain-language site nomenclature
Flexibility: If every object in your site has a name, everything can be found, styled, and programmatically manipulated much more easily
Accessibility: Named objects are more accessible to programmatic and style sheet control across all media types and give you flexibility in implementing universal accessibility features in your site
Search optimization: Careful site nomenclature makes it much easier to optimize a site for search engine visibility
Future growth and change: you can’t scale up or automate changes in a randomly named, haphazardly constructed collection of files and directories; a nonsystem can’t be systematically managed or structurally expanded
The hidden semantics of sites

The goal of semantic organization of your site is to produce a consistent, logical system of classifications for html and other files, directories, css components, and the various logical and visible divisions within your page templates. A consistent, modular approach to site construction can be scaled from small sites containing a dozen pages all the way up to content-managed sites consisting of tens of thousands of pages. Although we can present general principles for site structure here, the technical environment and functional demands of many sites may require particular forms of file naming. The fundamental point is that, whatever your site environment, you should develop systematic rules for naming every component of your site, make sure that everyone in the team understands and follows those rules, and use plain language wherever possible.

Naming conventions:

Never use technical or numeric gibberish to name a component when a plain-language name will do. In the early days of personal computing, clumsy systems like ms-dos and Windows 3.x imposed an “eight-dot-three” file name convention that forced users to make up cryptic codes for file and directory names (for example, “whtevr34.htm”). No word spaces and few non-alphanumeric characters were allowed in file names, so technologists often used characters like the underscore to add legibility (for example, “cats_003.htm”).

Habits developed over decades can be hard to break, and looking into the file structure of another team’s site can sometimes feel like cracking the German Enigma codes of World War II. Current file name conventions in Windows, Macintosh, and Linux systems are much more flexible, and there’s no reason to impose cryptic names on your team members, site users, and colleagues who may one day have to figure out how you constructed your site. There’s an old saying in programming that when you add explanatory comments to your code, the person you are mostly likely doing a favor for is yourself, three years from now. Three years from now, will you know what’s in a directory called “x83_0001”?

Naming pages, directories, and supporting files:
Although we think of web pages and their graphics as a unit, web page files do not contain graphics but consist instead of embedded links to separate graphics files. These embedded image links (<img src="graphic.jpg" alt="example">) are used by the web server to deliver a package consisting of an html file, plus all associated graphics, css or JavaScript files, and other media files. Most web “pages” are actually a constellation of files delivered to and assembled by the browser into the coherent page we see on our screens. Attention to file and directory names is essential to keeping track of the myriad pages and supporting files that make up a web site.

An example web page with mixed text, content graphics, and header graphics, showing the 12 HTML, CSS, and graphic files which combine to make up the page in a web browser.

Use language that anyone can understand:

Use plain-language names for all of your files and directories, separating the words with “breaking” hyphen characters. This system is easy to read and understand, and since conventional word spaces are not allowed, the hyphens “break” the file name into individual words or number strings that can be analyzed by search engines and will contribute to the search rankings and content relevance of your pages. We recommend this convention for directory names, too.

Mirror your visible site structure wherever possible:

Directory and file naming conventions that directly mirror the visible organization of your site are infinitely easier for your team and users to understand and will contribute to search engine rankings and relevance, because the whole url becomes a useful semantic guide to your content structure. Each component of your page url can contribute to search page ranking, but only if the names make sense in the context of your page content and relate to key words or phrases on the page.

This poorly named url contributes nothing to search engine relevance or site structure legibility:
```
www.whatever.edu/depts1/progs2/org004/bio_424.html
```
In contrast, anyone (and any search engine) can parse this plain-language content arrangement at a glance:
```
www.whatever.edu/departments/biology/ornithology/field-ornithology-bio-224.html
```
Always try to mirror the visible structure of your site’s content organization in the directory and file structure you set up on the web server (fig. 5.3).

Keep all your folder and file names lower case.

<h1>Code Validation</h1>

-----
Code Validation:

You can test whether your html (or, later, css or javascript) is valid, meaning it will be read properly by all standard browsers, by submitting it to a validator. I'll be using https://validator.w3.org (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to validate your code for grading, so you should check your work here before submitting it for grading. You can point it to a published page (not applicable for you yet), upload a file, or cut and paste your code. Some editing apps integrate code validation into the editor, showing you where you code might be invalid as you go along.

<b>Though it's not necessarily covered in the html tutorials, make sure you add the following line inside the head tag of your pages:
```
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
This will help the validator read the page without giving you an error saying the charset isn't defined.</b>
