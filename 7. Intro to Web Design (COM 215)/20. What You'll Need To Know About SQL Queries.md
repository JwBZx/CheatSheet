SQL SELECT Statement
❮ PreviousNext ❯
The SQL SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

SELECT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

SELECT * FROM table_name;
Demo Database

SQL WHERE Clause
❮ PreviousNext ❯
The SQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

WHERE Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statement, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE statement, etc.!

Demo Database
Below is a selection from the "Customers" table in the Northwind sample database:

CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Address	City	PostalCode	Country
1

Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Obere Str. 57	Berlin	12209	Germany
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	Ana Trujillo	Avda. de la Constitución 2222	México D.F.	05021	Mexico

WHERE Clause Example
The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

Operators in The WHERE Clause
The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:

Operator	Description
=	Equal
<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
> Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater than or equal
<=	Less than or equal
BETWEEN	Between an inclusive range
LIKE	Search for a pattern
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column

----------
SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
❮ PreviousNext ❯
The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND is TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

AND Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
OR Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
NOT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;

Combining AND, OR and NOT
You can also combine the AND, OR and NOT operators.

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city must be "Berlin" OR "München" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions):

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany" and NOT "USA":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';

SQL ORDER BY Keyword
❮ PreviousNext ❯
The SQL ORDER BY Keyword
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

ORDER BY Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

SQL Joins
❮ PreviousNext ❯
SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Let's look at a selection from the "Orders" table:

OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
10308	2	1996-09-18
10309	37	1996-09-19
10310	77	1996-09-20
Then, look at a selection from the "Customers" table:

CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Country
1	Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Germany
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	Ana Trujillo	Mexico
3	Antonio Moreno Taquería	Antonio Moreno	Mexico
Notice that the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table. The relationship between the two tables above is the "CustomerID" column.

Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that have matching values in both tables:

Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
Try it Yourself »
and it will produce something like this:

OrderID	CustomerName	OrderDate
10308	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	9/18/1996
10365	Antonio Moreno Taquería	11/27/1996
10383	Around the Horn	12/16/1996
10355	Around the Horn	11/15/1996
10278	Berglunds snabbköp	8/12/1996
Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records when there is a match in either left or right table

mysql fetch array
MySQL doesn't have a Fetch Array function. mysql_fetch_array is actually a PHP function that allows you to access data stored in the result returned from a successful mysql_query. If you have been jumping around our MySQL Tutorial then you would have already seen this function popping up all over the place.



Advertise on Tizag.com
This lesson will teach you how and why to use mysql_fetch_array in your PHP Scripts.

mysql_fetch_array: why use it?
Do you know what is returned when you used the mysql_query function to query a MySQL database? It isn't something you can directly manipulate, that is for sure. Here is a sample SELECT query of a table we created in the MySQL Create Table lesson.

PHP and MySQL Code:
<?php
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM example");
?>
The value that mysql_query returns and stores into $result is a special type of data, it is a MySQL Resource. Additional PHP functions are required to extract the data from this Resource.

a row of data
The mysql_fetch_array function takes a MySQL query resource as an argument ($result) and returns the first row of data returned by the mysql_query. Our table example basically looks like the table below.

example MySQL Table:
name	age
Timmy Mellowman	23
Sandy Smith	21
Bobby Wallace	15
The first row of data in this table is "Timmy Mellowman" and "23". When we fetch an array from our MySQL Resource $result it should have Timmy's name and age in it.

getting a row of data using mysql_fetch_array
mysql_fetch_array returns the first row in a MySQL Resource in the form of an associative array. The columns of the MySQL Result can be accessed by using the column names of the table. In our table example these are: name and age. Here is the code to print out the first MySQL Result row.

PHP and MySQL Code:
<?php
// Make a MySQL Connection
$query = "SELECT * FROM example";

$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());


$row = mysql_fetch_array($result) or die(mysql_error());
echo $row['name']. " - ". $row['age'];
?>
Display:
Timmy Mellowman - 23
This is just what we expected would happen! Now, the cool thing about mysql_fetch_array is that you can use it again on the same MySQL Resource to return the second, third, fourth and so on rows. You can keep doing this until the MySQL Resource has reached the end (which would be three times in our example).

Sounds like an awfully repetitive task. It would be nice if we could get all our results from a MySQL Resource in an easy to do script.

fetch array while loop
As we have said, the mysql_fetch_array function returns an associative array, but it also returns FALSE if there are no more rows to return! Using a PHP While Loop we can use this information to our advantage.

If we place the statement "$row = mysql_fetch_array()" as our while loop's conditional statement we will accomplish two things:

We will get a new row of MySQL information that we can print out each time the while loop checks its conditional statement.
When there are no more rows the function will return FALSE causing the while loop to stop!
Now that we know what we need to do and how to go about doing it, the code pretty much writes itself, so let's move on to the next lesson. Just kidding! Here is the code that will print out all the rows of our MySQL Resource.

PHP and MySQL Code:
<?php
// Make a MySQL Connection
$query = "SELECT * FROM example";

$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());


while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){
	echo $row['name']. " - ". $row['age'];
	echo "<br />";
}
?>
Display:
Timmy Mellowman - 23
Sandy Smith - 21
Bobby Wallace - 15
And there we have all the rows from our example table! You could apply this script to any MySQL table as long as you change both the table name in the query and the column names that we have in the associative array.

Creating drop down lists from MySQL data

Drop down lists (SELECT elements) are fairly common in HTML forms. They allow the user to select from a list rather than typing in the data making it easier and reducing typing errors.

To create a drop down in a form in HTML you list the possible choices as OPTIONS in a SELECT element. PHP can create this list from MySQL data. The confusion comes as usual with all the escaping of quotes but otherwise it is a fairly simple loop embedded in an HTML form.

The following code creates the form in HTML and starts PHP when it is needed:


<body>

    <form method="get" action="http://www.yourwebskills.com/files/examples/process.php">

        <select id="cd" name="cd">

            <?php

            $mysqlserver="localhost";
            $mysqlusername="test";
            $mysqlpassword="test";
            $link=mysql_connect(localhost, $mysqlusername, $mysqlpassword) or die ("Error connecting to mysql server: ".mysql_error());

            $dbname = 'test';
            mysql_select_db($dbname, $link) or die ("Error selecting specified database on mysql server: ".mysql_error());

            $cdquery="SELECT cdTitle FROM firsttable";
            $cdresult=mysql_query($cdquery) or die ("Query to get data from firsttable failed: ".mysql_error());

            while ($cdrow=mysql_fetch_array($cdresult)) {
            $cdTitle=$cdrow["cdTitle"];
                echo "<option>
                    $cdTitle
                </option>";

            }

            ?>

        </select>

    </form>

</body>            

Paste this into a new PHP page, save as mysqldropdown.php and upload. It should be fairly clear how it works but look again at that page which explained some of the fields which can be used in an HTML form if you need to.

The form uses the get method because that is what your processing form (formupdate2.php) uses. You will be using that page soon.

Purpose?

The user can now choose a CD from the list in the drop down.

You already saw how you can create links for the user to edit or delete data. This drop down list could be used as another way for the user to select a CD for further action. At the moment it is not complete but you are about to fix that.

Completing the process

At the moment the user chooses a cdTitle which is good for the user but not the database. The database needs to know the cdReference as that is the primary key. This is not a problem as HTML has a way to display one thing to the user but send another with the form:


<option value="23">
    Making Movies
</option>";

The VALUE attribute of the form field holds the CD reference for each entry in the drop down. It is the VALUE which is sent when the form is submitted.

This is how you show the user the CD title and artist but send the cdReference:


while ($cdrow=mysql_fetch_array($cdresult)) {
$cdTitle=$cdrow["cdTitle"];
$cdArtist=$cdrow["cdArtist"];
$cdReference=$cdrow["cdReference"];
    echo "<option value=\"$cdReference\">
        $cdTitle $cdArtist
    </option>";
}

Paste that in to replace your existing WHILE loop. Also change the SELECT query to include the cdArtist and cdReference fields:


$cdquery="SELECT cdTitle, cdArtist, cdReference FROM firsttable";

Test this version of the form and you should see three things being sent in the $_ GET array.

To finish you need a page to display the existing data for the chosen record in a form. You should have first done this on the page on updating database records with MySQL. You should have then altered the page for use with links created by PHP and using $_ GET. If you still have this page (formupdate2.php) use it as it should work unchanged. Change the ACTION of the form with the drop down to point to formupdate2.php.

The main reason for using $_ GET for the dropdown form is that it will not conflict with formupdate2.php which uses $_ POST.
