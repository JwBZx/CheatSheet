<h1>What You'll Be Doing With CSS Styling:</h1>

<h2>Create an external CSS file:</h2>

Create a file called style.css and place it in your top-most folder (the same one with your index file). In the head section of all the pages on your site, create a link that imports the css into that page.

<h2>Add style elements:</h2>

Using a single external CSS file, make at least four of the following style modifications to the content on your main page:

---
Define a different font family and style (color, weight, etc) for headings and for paragraphs (i.e. headings will look different than paragraphs). Here's a list (http://www.cssfontstack.com/) with examples of web-safe fonts (i.e. fonts that most computers will be able to render).
-
Add a full four-sided border around a content area.
-
Add a single border (bottom, left, etc) to a content area.
-
Style your links so that they are not the default blue underline, and so they react when hovered over.
-
Apply a different font definition to a sidebar or menu than what you have in the main headings and body paragraphs.
-
Remove the bullets or numbers from a list.
-
You can go beyond these steps if you wish. This is intended to get you tinkering, so style away.
